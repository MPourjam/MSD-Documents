MSD (Microbial Signature Database)
==================================

**Microbial Signatures Databse** (MSD) aims to assist biological consortia and laboratories with handling,
storing, analyzing and sharing their data of interest. We aim to provide a solution that safely stores sensitive
and non-sensitive data, enables their search by using custom filters, runs analyses that each user can tune to suit
their needs and finally gives the opportunity for each member of the platform to share the raw data and the results
with all other members of the platform. By using cutting-edge technologies, this platform guarantees the safety and
resilience of the deposited data, while simultaneously creating an intuitive and all-inclusive enviroment.
This platform is currently being financed by the grant: `CRC 1371 <https://www.sfb1371.tum.de/>`_.

Having access to MSD will enable the the researchers benfit from stadrardized metadata storage, integrated collection of 
data (16S, 18S, ITS, Metagenomics, Proteomics, Metabolomics, Transcriptomics), and project management using only one platform.
