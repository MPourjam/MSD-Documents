Registration of datasets to MSD
################################
    In this tutorial we go through the steps you need to take to upload your dataset (i.e: 16S Sequences) to MSD.
    You need to follow the steps in order.

.. include:: ./Registration/user_submit.rst

.. note::
    At MSD all kinds of Registration happen under **Submit** tab. Under this tab you can register *Protocols*,
    *Projects*, *Organisms*, *Samples*, *Datasets* (*16S*, *18S*, *ITS*, *Metabolomics*, *Transcriptomics*,
    *Proteomics*, *Metagenomics*).

.. include:: ./Registration/project_submit.rst

.. note::
    If you have your metadata stored at DIS (Data Integration System) and you have patient ID given
    by DIS. Then you can skip these steps and follow your step through :ref:`DIS users dataset submit`.
