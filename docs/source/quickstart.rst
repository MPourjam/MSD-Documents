Registration of datasets to MSD
-------------------------------

    In this tutorial we go through the steps needed to upload a dataset (i.e: 16S Sequences) to MSD one by one in order.

.. include:: ./Registration/user_submit.rst

.. note::
    At MSD all kinds of Registration happen under **Submit** tab. Under this tab user can register *Protocols*,
    *Projects*, *Organisms*, *Samples*, *Datasets* (*16S*, *18S*, *ITS*, *Metabolomics*, *Transcriptomics*,
    *Proteomics*, *Metagenomics*).

.. include:: ./Registration/project_submit.rst

.. note::
    If the metadata is already stored at DIS (Data Integration System) and there are patient IDs given
    by DIS. Then the following steps are not needed and may be skipped up to :ref:`DIS users dataset submit`.
