Origin View
-----------


MSD has an origin explorer to help finding the origin of the samples and their MSD ID. This ID is called **ORID** and contains information about 
origin of the samples at three levels: **Organ**, **Localization**, and **Material**. You can find the ORID of ther sample origin by going to **Overview** tab -> **Origins** sub-tab.
Searching keywords belonging to one of the aforementioned levels will output a list of origins with their corresponding ORID from which you can choose the origin which describes your
sample's origin the best.
