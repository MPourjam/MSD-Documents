MSD has a origin explorer by which you can find the origin of your samples and the ID MSD gives to them. This ID is called **ORID** and contains information about 
origin of your samples at three levels: **Organ**, **Localization**, and **Material**. You can find the ORID of your sample origin by going to **Overview** tab -> **Origins** sub-tab.
Searching keywords belonging to one of aforementioned levels will give you a list of origins with their corresponding ORID from which you can choose you the origin which describes your
sample's urging the best.
