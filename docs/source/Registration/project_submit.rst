Defining Project
----------------


MSD database schema tries to comply with every usual research project which starts with defining a project.
Similarly, the first step at MSD is also creation of a project to which all of the pertaining samples would be assigned.
In order to that follow the steps below.

Under **Submit** tab:

#. Click on **Project**
#. Give your project a **Name**
#. If the project is already registered at `SRA <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra>`_ [1]_ and you have an *accession* assigned, you can give it as **Accession** field to the project.
#. You can also give the project an **Acronym** for ease of use. Leaving it empty means no acronym for you project.
#. **Creator** is the owner of project. You have to select your *username*.
#. You *should* give the project **Description**. The more details the description contains, the more your project will appear in searches for datasets within various projects you have.
#. **Availability Checkbox** will make other users of MSD able to see the description of the project in their :ref:`Dashboard` and ask for permission to have access to the project datasets.
#. Click on **Create Project** to finalize the project creation.
