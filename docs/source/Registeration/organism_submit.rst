Defining Organisms
==================

.. _Register Organism:

So far we have submitted prerequisites to registeration of **Organisms**, **Samples** and **Datasets**.
 Registeration of Organism and then Samples comes always before datasets. It is *recommended* that by start of
 your project define your organisms at MSD and by each sampling attempt define your samples at MSD. Having done 
 that will help not only by tracking and documenting your porject but also by registeration of datasets.


 In order to register your organisms you need to do **two** major step. Firstly you need to **Create Template** 
 and then **Register Template**. For registration of *Samples* and *Datasets* these two major steps are folowed 
 as well.



Create Template
---------------

In order to create a template you need to click on *Organisms* tab and then *Create Template* tab.

Create Template
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You will see the various metadata tabs including **General Required Metadata**, **Human Required Metadata**,  
and **Mouse Required Metadata**.

* **General Required Metadata**: Under this tab there are genearal metadata required for each organism getting registerd at `MSD <https://www.misigdb.org/>`_
* **Human Required Metadata**: Metadata specific to *human* organisms.
* **Mouse Required Metadata**: Metadata specific to *mouse* organisms.

.. note::
    Currently all metadata attributes are preselected. We continue with preselected attributes and we later provide only related metadata.
