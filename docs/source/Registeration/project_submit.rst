#. Click on **Project**
#. Give your project a **Name**
#. If you have your project already registered at `*SRA* <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra>`_ [1]_ and you have an *accession* assigned, you can give it as **Accession** field to your project.
#. You can also give your project an **Acronym** for ease of use. Leaving it empty means no acronym for you project.
#. **Crceator** is the owner of project. You have to select your *username*.
#. You *should* give your project **Description**. The more you are descriptive, the more your project would get appreared in your searches for datasets within various projects you have.
