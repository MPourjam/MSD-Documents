Defining Protocols
==================

.. _Register Protocol:

Different projects might have different protocols for **Sampling**, **Sequencing**, **Analysis**, **Preparation**, and etc.
Each sample and dataset which is to be submitted to MSD should have a protocol assigned. Before registeration of organisms,
samples, and datasets to MSD you need to have the protocols you used for sample *preparation*, *sampling* as well as protocols
used for *Sequencing* and *Analysis*.


There are already some common protocols available at MSD which you can view and download at :ref:`Protocol View` tab.

The definition of different protol helps you with prtocol defninition.

* **Preparation Protocol**: This protocol refers to steps you have taken until your organism is prepared for sampling.
* **Sampling Protocol**: This protocol refers to steps taken to get samples for measurement (i.e: sequencing).
* **Sequencing Protocol**: This protocol refers to steps taken after sampling util a library is prepared for sequencing. If you have had your samples sequenced by **CFM** [2]_ then you don't need to define any *Sequencing* protocols and you can use the one provided by MSD: *Sequencing_protocol_Default*
* **Analyais Protocol**: This protocol refers to steps taken for processing the sample you have uploaded to MSD. As all your 16S amplicon sequences get analyzed at MSD, you don't need to define any *Analyais* protocols and you can use the one provided by MSD: *Analysis_protocol_Default*
