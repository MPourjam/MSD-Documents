Defining Samples
================

.. _Register Samples:


So far we have some organisms like below registered at **MSD**. It's time now to define samples which we have taken
from these organisms. The process of sample registration follows the genaral registration approach in MSD.


In order to register your organisms you need to do **three** major step. Firstly you need to **Create Template**, 
 **Fill the Template** ,and then **Register Template**. The same as registration of organisms which we did in previous section.



.. note::
    In order to submit your samples and make the relation to their corresponding organisms, you need to go to **Submit** tab in top bar -> **Samples** subtab.


I. Create Template
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Under **Samples** subtab you will see various other tabs named **Sample Required Metadata**, **Optional Human Metadata**, and **Optional Mouse/Pig Metadata**.
Below you can read description of each:\

* **Sample Required Metadata**: Under this tab you can see all metadata required for each sample to be registered at **MSD**. They are already preselected as they are required.
* **Optional Human Metadata**:  Under this tab you can see all metadata relevant to each sample **derived from human**. You can select of which metadata you want to store information in the databse. 
* **Optional Mouse/Pig Metadata**: Under this tab you can see all metadata relevant to each sample **derived from mouse or pig**. You can select of which metadata you want to store information in the databse.

.. note::
    For metadata whose value you don't provide a default value would be assigned in the database.

.. note::
    Also please be notified that for all of these optional metadata there would be **choices** to choose in the excel template.

After you have selected your desired metadata, it's time to create an **Excel template** with desired columns representing your chosen metadta.
To do so click on **Create Sample Template** button.

As an example in the figure below, I am creating a template to submit **both** *human* and *mouse* samples to organisms I defined in :ref:`Register Organism` part.


.. figure:: /media/Sample_Create_Template_required.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 100 %
    :alt: Create Organism Template - Required Metadata
    :class: sample_registration_scsh

    All *required* sample metadata are already selecte.


.. figure:: /media/Sample_Create_Template_human.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 100 %
    :alt: Create Organism Template - Human Metadata
    :class: sample_registration_scsh

    You can select any number of human-related metadata and create an excel
    containing these metadta as columns to fill.


.. figure:: /media/Sample_Create_Template_mouse.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 100 %
    :alt: Create Organism Template - Mouse Metadata
    :class: sample_registration_scsh

    You can select any number of mouse-related metadata and create an excel
    containing these metadta as columns to fill.


    
Now that I have selected metadta I want to provide for pool of my samples being to upload, I click on **Create Sample Template** button to download the
excel tamplate with desired metadata to fill.

II. Fill in the Template
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

III. Uploading Template
